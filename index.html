<p><a><em>The Valley of Lost thoughts:</em></a> The valley would be filled with ethereal
  landscapes, where the terrain is made up of soft, rolling hills and deep 
  crevices. The color palette could be muted with occasional bursts of color 
  representing fleeting memories or important thoughts trying to resurface. 
  Scattered throughout the valley could be statues or monuments half-covered
  in fog, symbolizing incomplete or fragmented memories. Some paths might lead
  to dead ends or loop back on themselves, creating a sense of confusion and 
  disorientation. Ghostly figures might wander aimlessly, representing thoughts
  that have lost their purpose or meaning. Occasionally, a clearer figure might
  appear, guiding the player to a memory that needs to be reclaimed 
  (Leading Thought).</p>

<p><a id = "CT"><em>The Cortex Castle:</em></a> The Cortex Castle stands as a testament to the 
  mind’s capacity for complex thought and reasoning. Its towering spires
  and intricate parapets are carved from the very substance of cognitive
  processes, each stone representing a neuron in the vast network of the brain.</p>
 <img src="The Cortex Castle.jpeg" alt="Alt text" title="Optional title">
<p><a id = "archive"><em>Archive of the Unspoken:</em></a> A library filled with books that contain 
  words never said, thoughts never shared. This could be a place of puzzles
  where players piece together messages to unlock deeper parts of the mind. 
  Which is a part of <a href = "#CT">the cortex castle</a>.</p>

  <p><a id = "CD"><em>The Cerebellum Docks:</em></a>   The docks are a complex network of piers
  and platforms. The air is filled with the sounds of waves lapping 
  against the docks and the rhythmic creaking of the ships. The docks
  are constructed with a blend of sturdy wood and neural tissue, pulsating
  with the energy of muscle memory. Ships of various sizes, symbolizing
  different motor functions, are moored to the docks, swaying gently with 
  the cerebral currents. This is behind the cortex castle.</p>

<p><a id = "SC"><em>Summit of Consciousness:</em><a/> The summit is bathed in a soft, golden light, 
  symbolizing enlightenment and understanding. The landscape below is a 
  tapestry of the mind's experiences. Monoliths of pure thought dot the
  landscape, each representing a cornerstone of the individual’s identity.
  These structures are interconnected by bridges of light, signifying the 
  connections between different aspects of the self. Bathed in a radiant 
  light that cuts through the surrounding mists of uncertainty. The ground 
  is crystalline, reflecting thoughts and memories in vivid detail. When you 
  ride away from the cerebellum docks you arrive at the Summit of Consciousness.
  Thus is the end of the beginning.</p>
